  <p>My name is Carlos Alonso. I am a Computer Engineer by the University of Salamanca (Spain). My passion for technology and its continuous evolution and my huge appetite for learning have made me an experienced ‘full stack’ developer.</p>

  <p>My development skills cover all the way from the database to the browser when it comes to web servers and full iOS when talking about mobile applications and/or video games.</p>

  <p>Currently I am working as a Software Engineer at MyDrive Solutions in London and also lecturing MIMO Masters Degree at Pontifical University of Salamanca (Spain) as well as Mobile Applications Development Diploma at Bolivarian Pontifical University (Colombia).</p>

  <p>I am always actively looking for new opportunities to satisfy my willingness to learn and improve my professional skills.</p>
