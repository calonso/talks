# Swift and Big Data

Talk for the [Christmas Get-Together Swift London Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/swiftlondon/events/218876699/)

This talk is the result of [this blog post](http://mrcalonso.com/ios-data-collection-using-swift/) where I tried to show a different approach of using Swift programming language specially focused in memory management and performance.
